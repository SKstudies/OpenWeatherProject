Steps to Create an Interactive Weather App in React:
1. Set Up React Project:
Create a new React project using Create React App or any preferred method.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Create Components:
Design and create necessary components such as App, WeatherCard, SearchBar, etc., for the application.
3. Fetch Weather Data:
Utilize the fetch or axios library to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Use the API endpoint to get weather information based on city names or coordinates.
4. Display Weather Information:
Create a component (WeatherCard) to display weather information fetched from the API.
Display relevant details such as temperature, weather condition, location, etc.
Use icons or images to represent weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.).
5. Implement Search Functionality:
Develop a search bar component (SearchBar) that allows users to input city names.
Upon submission, trigger the API call to fetch weather data for the entered city.
6. Integrate User Geolocation (Optional):
Use the browser's Geolocation API to fetch the user's coordinates.
Fetch weather data based on the user's current location.
7. Make App Responsive:
Design the app layout to be responsive using CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap.
Ensure the app looks good and functions well on different devices and screen sizes.
8. Clean Code and Component Organization:
Implement clean and modular code practices.
Organize components, state management, and API calls efficiently.
9. Testing and Refinement:
Test the application thoroughly, ensuring all features work as expected.
Refine the UI/UX and functionality based on testing feedback.
10. Code Sandbox Link:
Once completed, provide a CodeSandbox link to showcase the working weather application.
Additional Tips:
Use environment variables to securely store API keys.
Implement error handling for cases like invalid city names or failed API requests.
Use React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect, etc.).
Consider adding additional features like temperature units conversion, 5-day forecasts, etc., for extra credit.
